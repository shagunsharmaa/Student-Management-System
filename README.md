# Gesture-Controlled-Volume-Controller

The Hand Gesture Volume Control is a Python script that allows you to control the volume of your computer's audio using hand gestures detected through a webcam. By utilizing computer vision techniques and the MediaPipe library, it tracks the movements of your hand and calculates the distance between two specific landmarks to adjust the volume accordingly. This project provides a hands-free and intuitive way to control the audio volume without physical buttons or a mouse.
